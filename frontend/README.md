# Getting Started With The Frontend
* Clone the repo
* `cd` into `frontend`
* Run `npm install` or `yarn add` to install all dependencies in the package.json

# When Making Changes
Before you can see if your changes are working, you need to make sure of a couple of things:
* Making sure the django server is running.
* Run `npm run build` in the `frontend` directory, and wait for the build to finish.

Once the build is done, you can refresh the page and test your changes.
